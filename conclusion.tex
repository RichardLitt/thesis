\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future-work}


- Peer-to-peer solution for sharing code
  - Stub out example
  - Build a web searcher for automatically getting and sharing code
    Further Work:
  - Open source data repositories (touch on)
  - Working with Ethnologue


\subsection{Storage on a p2p network}

Build a web-application tool for serving a decentralized data store for endangered language tools and data

Example:

I have already put a subset of repositories listed on endangered-languages into IPFS, a p2p resource for storing and disseminating data in a decentralized and persistent fashion.

Process:

1. `cat` the endangered-languages README.md, then `grep` for `/.*(//github\.com/.*?/[a-zA-Z0-9-]*).*/` (all github.com repos).
2. Output list into separate file.
3. `awk` the first few repos, until a random divider, and clone the git repos: `awk '1;/kuromoji-server/{exit}' ../githublist.md | xargs -n1 git clone`
4. `ipfs add -r repos`
5. `ipfs pin add repos`
