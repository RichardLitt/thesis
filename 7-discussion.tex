\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

Here, I want to drive home the point; how open source can help languages. Specifically, I will cover:

\subsection{Why isn't more code open?}

Finally, I'll go into a little detail on the question of why more hasn't been open sourced, and how to find open source resources.
% - Longevity of linguistic scholarship and work

\subsection{How does open source demonstrably help?}

I'll talk about use cases where open source has actually helped languages. This will include, for instance, NLTK case studies.
