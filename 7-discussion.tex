\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

Here, I want to drive home the point; how open source can help languages. Specifically, I will cover:

\subsection{Why isn't more code open?}

Finally, I'll go into a little detail on the question of why more hasn't been open sourced, and how to find open source resources.
% - Longevity of linguistic scholarship and work

\subsection{How does open source demonstrably help?}

I'll talk about use cases where open source has actually helped languages. This will include, for instance, NLTK case studies.

\subsection{Deep ecology and biocultural sustainability}

Worth mentioning that language is part of a whole picture, and doesn't exist by itself.

% Donna Haraway in fact suggests we substitute the term Capitalocene for anthropocene, and it is precisely in an attempt to break with the oikos of the ‘restricted economy’ of the capitalocene that I propose general ecology as the framework for what I will call biocultural sustainability.}
